**Review your knowledge of outliers in the quiz below.**

```{r echo = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```


```{r setup, echo = F}
# This is any code you wan to automatically run when the user starts the quiz
library(learnr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Exercise 1: Identifying and Measuring Outliers


```{r mc-question}
question("What is measure of an observation's 
        overall impact on the model called? Formula = $\\large \\frac{1}{p}(std. res._{i})^{2}(\\frac{h_{i}}{1-h_{i}})$",
    answer("Cook's Distance", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Leverage", message = "Leverage measures the distance between an observation's values of the predictor variables and the 
        average values of the predictor variables"),
    answer("Standardized residuals", message = "The standardized residual is the residual divided by the standard error. The residual is an observation's actual value minus the model's predicted value for that observation."), 
    answer("Residual", message = "We don't use regular residuals to measure outliers. Try again."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = TRUE #randomize answer choices
  )
```

## Exercise 2: Removing Outliers 

```{r mc-question}
question("You see some obvious outlier observations in your data set. They 
  stand out because although the values of their predictor variables are         common, the response variable values for these observations are extremely low. Can you remove these observations from your model?",
    answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = "Removing an outlier simply because of an unusual value in the response variable is NEVER a viable option. These outliers are legitimate observations and belong in your model."),
    answer("Yes", message = "Do these observations have unusual predictor values or response values?"),
    answer("It depends on the model", message = "Try again."), 
    allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = TRUE #randomize answer choices
  )
```

## Exercise 3: Identify Outliers 

```{r mc-question}
question("An observation has a standardized residual of 2.5. Is it an outlier?",
    answer("Yes", correct = TRUE,),
    answer("No"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = FALSE #randomize answer choices
  )
```

## Exercise 4: Dealing With Outliers 

```{r mc-question}
question("An observation has a standardized residual of 2.5. Should we remove it from the model?",
    answer("Not enough information", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Yes", message = "It's an outlier, but we don't remove all outliers from our models."),
    answer("No", message = "If the outlier is an influential point (it significantly pulls the model toward it) and it has an unusual predictor variable value, it may be the right thing to do to remove it."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = FALSE #randomize answer choices
  )
```
