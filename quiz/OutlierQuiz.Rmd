**Review your knowledge of outliers in the quiz below.**

```{r echo = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```


```{r setup, echo = F}
# This is any code you wan to automatically run when the user starts the quiz
library(learnr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Exercise 1: Identifying and Measuring Outliers


```{r mc-question}
question("What is measure of an observation's 
        overall impact on the model called? Formula = $\\large \\frac{1}{p}(std. res._{i})^{2}(\\frac{h_{i}}{1-h_{i}})$",
    answer("Cook's Distance", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Leverage", message = "Leverage measures the distance between an observation's values of the predictor variables and the 
        average values of the predictor variables"),
    answer("Standardized residuals", message = "The standardized residual is the residual divided by the standard error. The residual is an observation's actual value minus the model's predicted value for that observation."), 
    answer("Residual", message = "We don't use regular residuals to measure outliers. Try again."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = TRUE #randomize answer choices
  )
```

## Exercise 2: Select multiple responses 

```{r multi-select-quest}
question("Which of the following best describes the points on the plot?",
    answer("The shape is the same for all points.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The color is the same for all points.", message = "Hint: look at the aesthetic"),
    answer("The color and shape are the same for all points.", message = "Are shape and color defined in the aesthetic?"), 
    answer("The color is determined based on the cut of the diamond", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = TRUE #randomize answer choices
  )
```

## Exercise 3: Coding question 

Fill in the code below to change the shape based on the clarity. 
```{r coding-question, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut, shape = ___))
```

## Exercise 4: Use Latex 

```{r latex-question}
question(sprintf("Suppose we have the null hypothesis $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$. Which is of the following is a two-sided alternative hypohteiss?"),
  answer(sprintf("$\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0$"), correct = TRUE),
  answer(sprintf("$\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 > 0$"), message = "This is one-sided"),
  answer(sprintf("$\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 < 0$")),
  allow_retry = TRUE,  #students can try questions multiple times. 
    random_answer_order = TRUE #randomize answer choices
)
```
